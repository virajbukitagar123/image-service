# Animated GIF library for Java

This code is a re-package of the Animated GIF processing classes made
available by Kevin Weiner at http://www.fmsware.com/stuff/gif.html, which
states that the code "may be freely used for any purpose. _Unisys patent
restrictions may apply to the LZW portions._".

You may find the following link relevant in determining the current extent
of the Unisys patent restrictions:

The classes are largely unaltered, though as the code was originally placed in
the 'default' package, I've assigned the Java package name of
`com.madgag.gif.fmsware`.

This repo is intended mainly for packaging those classes into a
maven-friendly format - for full attribution of the original code, check
the Java file headers.

Where alterations have occurred since the initial import, those changes are
licenced under the Apache V2 licence.
